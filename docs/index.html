<p>I wanted to host a simple website somewhere and know that it would not go down when I forget to pay the hosting. That is why I chose Github Pages as my hosting platform. Github Pages only has one problem. I do not want to write HTML. This lead to ThonelJS creation. ThonelJS automatically generates new HTML and updates it to the git repository.</p>
<p>I also made a simple web server which made it possible to preview the website locally at <a href="http://localhost:8000">localhost:8000</a>. </p>

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>As a blogger you should only focus onto the <code>content</code> folder and most specifically <code>articles</code> folder inside it. <code>articles</code> folder contains your blog posts. The title will be grabbed from the filename (<code>.md</code> suffix will be removed) so writing title inside markdown file is unnecessary (and leads to duplicate title). </p>
<p><code>/content/info.json</code> is like your blog settings. It uses JSON to store the website title and description. </p>
<p><code>/content/index.md</code> is the frontpage of your website. If you rename or remove it the frontpage will show a list of all the blog posts. The same applies to <code>/content/about.md</code> which will be shown only if it exists.</p>
<p>If you want to preview the changes before pushing them (very much RECOMMENDED) you can do that by running <code>node .</code> in the ThonelJS folder. This although requires Node.JS to be installed on your machine.</p>
