First I tried to read other <a href="https://jamstack.org/generators/">static site generator</a> names to find my own. This was not a success. </p>
<p>I continued searching and found two websites. These websites generated names for projects. They were <a href="http://codenames.herokuapp.com/">codenames.herokuapp.com</a> and <a href="https://mrsharpoblunto.github.io/foswig.js/">foswig.js</a>. I used the latter to find the current name, ThanolJS. Originally it suggested thanol which was already reserver so added suffix JS into it. </p>
<p>The next problem was icon. I did not want the organization to look like some random new Github profile. That is why I went to <a href="https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/">favicon.io</a>. I was able to generate a pretty looking white <code>T</code> on black background with following settings:</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Text:</strong> <em>T</em></p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> <em>Rounded</em></p>
<p><strong>Font Family:</strong> <em>Leckerli One</em></p>
<p><strong>Font Variant:</strong> <em>Regular 400 Normal</em></p>
<p><strong>Font Size:</strong> <em>110</em></p>
<p><strong>Font Color:</strong> <code>#FFFFFF</code></p>
<p><strong>Background Color:</strong> <code>#222</code></p>
