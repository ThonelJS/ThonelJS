<p>I wanted to host a simple website somewhere and know that it would not go down when I forget to pay the hosting. That is why I chose Github Pages as my hosting platform. Github Pages only has one problem. I do not want to write HTML. This lead to ThonelJS creation. ThonelJS automatically generates new HTML and updates it to the git repository.</p>
<p>I also made a simple web server which made it possible to preview the website locally at <a href="http://localhost:8000">localhost:8000</a>. </p>

<p>Web development and server management have always been important for me. I also follow actively activities on the cyber security field and try to understand them. The fascinating idea that code will be deployed automatically after it is finished has pushed me to learn more about Github Actions. I currentely use Docker to self-host email, password manager and file storage but I am looking forward to examine Kubernetes and Docker swarm.</p>
