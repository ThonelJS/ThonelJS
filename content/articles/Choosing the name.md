Choosing the name for a project has always been very difficult to me. First I tried to read other [static site generator](https://jamstack.org/generators/) names to find my own. This was not a success. 

I continued searching and found two websites. These websites generated names for projects. They were [codenames.herokuapp.com](http://codenames.herokuapp.com/) and [foswig.js](https://mrsharpoblunto.github.io/foswig.js/). I used the latter to find the current name, ThanolJS. Originally it suggested thanol which was already reserver so added suffix JS into it. 

The next problem was icon. I did not want the organization to look like some random new Github profile. That is why I went to [favicon.io](https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/). I was able to generate a pretty looking white `T` on black background with following settings:

----

**Font Family:** *Leckerli One*

**Font Variant:** *Regular 400 Normal*
